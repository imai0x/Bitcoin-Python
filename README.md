## Installation:
First, you must install the library **requests**.

Do that with ``pipenv install requests``.

## Usage:
Run ``python getprice.py`` to start the project.

## Description

This is a python application, where you can see as an output the current price of one Bitcoin.

**Note from the developer of the main repository (delete it when you fork it):**

My main purpose for creating this project is to learn more about Python and its libraries.

## Planned updates:

- **Web page:** 

IÂ´ve planned to integrate Flask and to create a web page where you can see the current price of one Bitcoin.

It will look like the **[Node.js Bitcoin Application](https://github.com/julianYaman/bitcoinPriceApplication_web)**.
